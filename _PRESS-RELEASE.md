There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Daily Species Sightings Database

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  The market is safari lodges who need to keep track of the animal sightings over time in order to identify patterns, study territorial behaviours and identify specific animals.

## Summary ##
  > A tool for logging daily animal sightings on a map of the property, that will allow the user to view all sightings for a particular time period and ultimately interogate the data visually to identify patterns over time, across species and for specific animals.

## Problem ##
  > Many lodges manage this data in a manual (pen and paper logbook) way, in conjunction with spreasheets.  Each lodge has their own approach.

## Solution ##
  > Provides an automated, user friendly central respository for storing and visualising species data in the reserve, allowing lodges to better understand their animal populations and land dynamics. A consistent approach to recording and storing data across properties provides a better starting point for understanding data across different properties and over time.

## Quote from You ##
  > I like animals and stuff.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Any lodge can get up and running in minimal time - sign up for an account, specify the boundaries of your property, and start adding data points!

## Customer Quote ##
  > The Sightings Database has given us visibility over our game viewing data in a way that was not previously possible, right down to a granular specific animal level, through to species level patterns over time, enabling us to better direct our efforts in providing guests with a world class safari experience.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
